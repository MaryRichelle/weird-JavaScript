# Weird ðŸ™„ behavior of Coolest JavaScript

```js
var amount = 42
console.log(amount)
```

why its weird ðŸ˜µ

- console.log(......) command has to implicitly coerce the *number 42* value to a *string* value to print it out

- javascript work on the right side of = *assignment operator* and then assign that value to left hand side

***

```js
let a = "52";
let b = 52
a ==b // true 
typeof (a==b); // boolean
a === b // false
// (that's weird ðŸ™„)
```
true because type coercion happens behind the walls javascript  tries to convert the type of one of the operand of == operator to match them  and _a_ "42" becomes 42

with === the coercion is not allowed  
***

```js
true != 1;  // false (that's weird ðŸ™„)  
true !== 1; // true (that's weird ðŸ™„)
```

 with Inequality != operator  type coercion occurs  true becomes 1 and its false
 !== Strict Inequality operator type coercion is not allowed true and 1 are not same
 ***

``` js
b *2
```

why its weird ðŸ˜µ
a standalone *expression statement* is not very useful and common as it will not have any effect on running the program it would retrieve the value of of b and multiply it by 2 but than wouldn't do anything with the result. which means javascript will run line by line will execute this expression and move to next line but if we want to use it we can store it in a variable and use it (that's weird ðŸ™„)
***

```js
 console.log( typeof null) 
 ```

why its weird ðŸ˜µ?  
typeof null is "object" (that's weird ðŸ™„)
even null is primitive value in but type of null is object
***

***

```js
const arr = [1,2,3,4,5,5,,6]
const a= arr.map((x,y)=> x+y)
 console.log(a)// [ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, <1 empty item>, 13 ]
```

***

```js
var employeeId = '1234abe';
(function(){
console.log(employeeId);// undefined 
var employeeId = '122345';
})();
```

why its weird ðŸ˜µ?  
it is undefined because of hoisting  moves  variable at the top of the scope and at the point var employeeId is just declared but not yet initialize (that's weird ðŸ™„)

***
What is the output of this code?

```js
let x = 9;
let y = x++; // y= 9 x= 10 (that's weird ðŸ™„)
console.log(++x *  y) ; // 11* 9 (that's weird ðŸ™„)
```

why its weird ðŸ˜µ?  
on line *let y = x++* x is incremented after its current value is assigned to y
<!-- increment on the right side of assignment operator = value of x increase by 1 but 1 and than its assign to y so the value of x is 10 and y = 9  -->

***

```js
function myFunc(){
console.log(this.message);// undefined
}//(that's weird ðŸ™„)
myFunc.message = "Hi John";// setting a property to function 
myFunc()
```

why its weird ðŸ˜µ?  
but properties in function are not directly accessible
***

```js

let a = 5;
let b = a++; //a = 6, b= 5 (that's weird ðŸ™„)
let c = ++a; // a = 7, c = 7 (that's weird ðŸ™„)

let result = a + b + c; // 19

console.log(result);
```

***

```js
function myFun(){
var arrayNumb = [2, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42];
arrayNumb.sort();
console.log(arrayNumb);// [ 15, 16, 2, 23, 42, 8 ] 
const prices = ["a", "b", "f", "e", "d","c"];
prices.sort();
console.log(prices);
}
myFun()
```

why its weird ðŸ˜µ?  
one that sorts an array in place and sort method with out argument  reacts on elements of array  as string and sort them in dictionary order (lexicographic ) (that's weird ðŸ™„)
***

```js
let x=10 ; 
let y='hello';
console.log(Number('5'+x));//  output : 510 (that's weird ðŸ™„)
console.log(`The result ${y} and`+ false); // 'The result hello andfalse'
```

why its weird ðŸ˜µ?   
  string concatenation because of + operator with typeof number and string accordingly  

***

```js  
const num = () =>{

return 9;
};

console.log(num() < 10); // true
```

num function returns 9 which is less than 10  
***

```js
console.log(4 + (5 - - 4) - - 5)// 18
```

1:(5 - - 4) => 5 +4 => 9
2: 4 + 9 => 13
3: 13 - - 5 => 13 + 5 => 18
***

```js
console.log([10]+[10]); // "1010"
console.log([10]+[10,10]); //'1010,10'
console.log([1, 2] + [3, 4]);// 1,23,4 

```

why its weird ðŸ˜µ?  

because of + operator array are coerced to strings "10" , "10,10" (that's weird ðŸ™„)  
***

```js
console.log(1..toString() === "1");// true (that's weird ðŸ™„)
```

why its weird ðŸ˜µ?  
1: floating point 1.0   
2: .toString()   
first . is for floating point 1.0  
***

```js
const value = "123abc";
const result = Number(value);

console.log(typeof result); "number" 
```

***

```js
const obj1 = { a: 0 };
const obj2 = Object.assign({}, obj1);

obj1.a = 2;
console.log(obj1, obj2);// { a: 2 } { a: 0 }
```

why its weird ðŸ˜µ?  
obj2 have all the the value of it and add new obj1 so its { a: 0 }  
later obj1 value of property a was changed but not in the obj2        
***

***

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr[5] = 6;
console.log(arr.length); //6 with two empty spaces
```

***

```js

function display()  
{  
  console.log("10"+(20+30));  // "1050"
    console.log("10"+20+30); // 102030
console.log(10+20+"30") // 3030

}  
display();  
```

why its weird ðŸ˜µ?  
 string concatenation because of +  
***

```js

let a=[]
let b=""
console.log(a==b) // true
```

why its weird ðŸ˜µ?  
loose equal  == converts  one or both values to same type and [] is converted to ""
[] = "" // true
***

```js

var greet = 'Hello World';
var toGreet = [].filter.call(greet, function(element, index) {
return index > 5;
});
console.log(toGreet);
```

***

```js

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a // reference to a as array are pass by reference
a = a + [4] // 1,2,34 both a and [4]converted to string and concat
console.log(b) // [1, 2, 3] a was assign to b before it changes it values on a = a + [4]
```

(that's weird ðŸ™„)
***

```js

 const arr = [1,2,3,4,5,5,,6]
 const a= arr.slice()
 console.log(a) // [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, <1 empty item>, 6 ]
```

***

```js

console.log("hello");

setTimeout(() => console.log("world"), 0);

console.log("hi");


```

(that's weird ðŸ™„)  
"hello"  
"hi"  
"world"  
why its weird ðŸ˜µ?    
setTimeout is async function and it give space to other code to execute first even  it set to 0

***

```js

function test(x){
if(x > 0){
test(x-1)
}
console.log(x)// 0 1 2 3 4 5
}
let data = 5
test(data);
```

why its weird ðŸ˜µ?    

***

```js
function fun(a, b, c) {
return b + c
}
fun(5, 3, "wowwwwww", "this is so cool") // '3wowwwwww' string concatenation 
```

```js
setTimeout(()=>{console.log("second")},0)
console.log("first")

```

"first"  
"second"   
set time out  is Asynchronous  
***

```js
let v =[56,67,21,78,(1,2,3),(4,5,6)];
let [a,b,...c]  = v
console.log(c); // [ 21, 78, 3, 6 ]
console.log(a)//56
console.log(b)//67

```
***
```js

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, NaN];
console.log(numbers.indexOf(NaN), typeof numbers[-1] );// -1 'undefined'
```

Javascript is not yet done...... continue... (that's weird ðŸ™„)
